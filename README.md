# FederatedLearning


In the lab, we will explore the application of **federated learning** for binary classification on a **diabetes dataset**. Our goal is to build a model that can predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on various features such as age, BMI, and blood pressure.

We use TensorFlow Federated (TFF) to implement our federated learning approach and evaluate the performance of our model using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
